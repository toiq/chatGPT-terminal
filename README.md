# ChatGPT for the Terminal
This project was done using unofficial ChatGPT API.

To Run:
* Clone this repo
* Go to chat.openai.com/chat 
* Get your session key(__Secure-next-auth.session-token) value from cookies
* Rename the .env.sample file to .env
* set `SESSION_TOKEN="Your Session key token"`
* run `npm start` from terminal

Note: ChatGPT isn't the fastest thing right now because so many people are using it. So yes, it can take some time to get answers (Sometimes you may not even get answers!)
